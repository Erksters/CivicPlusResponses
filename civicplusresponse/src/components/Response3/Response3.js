    Good morning Mary. Thank you for calling CivicPlus as we’re always happy to help our Clients. 
    I sincerely apologize for what happened in your prior phone call with us,
     but I will not let that define our conversation today. 
         `

    var text2 = `I assure you that the applications you are looking for still exist. They were moved to a different location.
     On my end, I see that you currently have 10 applications in your Archived Bin.
      What we’re going to do today is get your applications out of the Archived Bin 
      and take note on how to prevent this issue from happening again.
        `;

    var text3 = `
    If you’d like to see me move your applications out of the Archived Bin and return them to their original place,
     then we can set up a zoom call so you can see my screen and follow along on your computer. 
     Otherwise I can tell you which buttons to press over this phone call.

    If the client is absolutely uncooperative and does not want to troubleshoot with me…

        Do we have any video tutorials on this? Such as a Youtube channel dedicated to customer support?
