    I am having a lot of problems trying to figure out your software and I think I just deleted all of my job applications. 
   I'm worried that I'll never get them back. This wouldn't be the first time your software
    gets me this upset and last time I called I had an awful experience.
   How was I supposed to know that the archive button makes the applications dissappear?
   Where did they go? I usually asked my nephew Erick for help on these situations but he's 
   currently out of town. I want you guys to make better software and hire better programmers, 
   so us older folk can still get a grip on these types of things.
